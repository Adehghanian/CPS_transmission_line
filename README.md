CPS (Coplanar Stripline) Transmission Line

The Coplanar Stripline (CPS) is a type of transmission line used in high-frequency and microwave circuits. It consists of two parallel conductive strips on the same plane, separated by a dielectric material. CPS is widely used in RF and microwave applications due to its compact structure, ease of fabrication, and excellent high-frequency performance.
